          <p className="mb-6">
            Reich and Baumer's (2023) comprehensive research reveals that modern
            AI detection tools have evolved significantly to meet the challenges
            of increasingly sophisticated AI writing systems. Unlike early
            detection methods that relied on simple pattern matching, current
            tools employ multiple layers of analysis to identify AI-generated
            content.

                measures how random or predictable the text appears. Human
                writing typically shows more variability in its randomness
                patterns compared to AI-generated text, which often maintains a
                more consistent level of predictability throughout.

                uniform complexity levels.
